<h1>How is SSH used to execute a command?</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph. Other text...</p>
<p>The SSH client program can be used for logging into a remote machine or server and for executing commands on a remote machine. When command is specified,
  it is executed on the remote host/server instead of a login shell. The syntax is as follows for executing commands over ssh: ssh user1@server1 command1.</p>
